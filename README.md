 UX

 - The site is responsive that makes it easy accessible in all platforms.
 - This gives the user access to the site at all times. making it practicle and valuable to human-technology interaction in all softwares. Making it very efficient to all demographics.
 
Testing
- 
- Testing was done on google chrome and sent the links to the users through whatsapp.the links worked.
- I also used the WÂ£validator site to test the CSS and hTML code.
- discovered that the social like were not visible. I found the problem was with the css styling.And it is now fixed and they are  visible for the user
- The image carousel had a problem as well. The indicators were not visible to the user. I decided to  use inline block display at the gallery page .
- During validation i found more that 40 errors. I tried to fix the errors but not all of them . I will revisit the site againto try and fix them.
- Most of the testing was done with friends and workmates, i uploaded gitpod app on my phone, this made it easy to access and sent the link via whats app to the user.

 
 User story


The purpose of this site is to offer a user an appealing and user friendly platform to navigate around and sell the product to the customer
This platfoam is to aanble the customer.
 - as a user they would like to navigate through the pages without heading back tothe home page at all times discover new and interesting destinations. I created a navbar inecah page tomake it easier for the user to navigate through all all pages 	
 - The user wanted to book and make make inquiries about the intangible products within the bookings. We created a contact page to send inquiries via email.
 - The youtube video [Trysafari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSCGJD_H-n8). Created using the adobe sp software editing platform to create a vision that will enable the user to connect with the product visiualisation.
 - To be recommended destinations.
 - To be able to new bigger picture that will embody our vision and the desire of the user by creating a new experience.  
	

 Ordered steps

 - To be recommended destinations on interest errors of unclosed abd open tags in the index page and corrected all of them.
 - receiver errors in the about me bage  

 - To be able to browse activities to create a new experience  


 Troubleshootings 

- we discovered that the navigation bar tool was not working so i had to use a navbar instead of the menubar buttons. Used theBootstarp dropdown bars and researched how to create navbars in youtube
- All users should be able to access easily through the pages with no delays , as defined on the site.
- After creating the pages should be accessible and be displayed in both the desktop and by phone. should checking that all the pages are responsively active
- Some of the images were pixilated  i was able to access good images in the free stock photos at the pexels site https://www.pexels.com/ 
- Some of the images sizes were too big so i used picresize webpage https://picresize.com/# to resize the images that would suite the site according to the users preference
